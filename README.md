# Language-Detection-System
This project is a Language Detection System built with Python and Machine Learning. It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Naive Bayes classifier to accurately identify the language of a given text. The model is trained on a multilingual dataset and supports fast, real-time predictions.
